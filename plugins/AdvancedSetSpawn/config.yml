# Conditions:
# bypass-cooldown-ops (true/false) removes the cooldown on spawn request by permission.
# check-location (true/false) before teleporting check if player has teleported
# TIP > I recommend using this with onMoveEvent to avoid players bypassing it...
# cooldown (In seconds) how much the player will wait until he got teleported to the spawn point.
# period-nofalldamage (In seconds) starts when a player was recently teleported in to the spawn.
# prevent-falldamage (true/false) it will only prevent for the first fall damage you get
#                                 after teleported to the spawn point.
# prevent-tpall-ops (true/false) if u have "aspawn.notpall" permission u will avoid going to the spawn.
# spawn-onDeath (true/false) sends a player to the spawn before they die...
# spawn-onJoin (true/false) sends a player to the spawn when they join to the server
# spawn-onVoid (true/false) sends a player to the spawn if they fall in the void.
# Toggle:
# aspawn-permission (true/false) toggles the access to the /aspawn command.
# disable-onMoveEvent (true/false) Check if player moved at least 1 block, this was optimized...
# TIP > If you don't want this event, cause lag or its unnecessary so set it to true.
#       If you disabled this (true) your players will be able to move on teleport request.
